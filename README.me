# 100 Days of SwiftUI

This repository stores all the projects that I built with the online course [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) by Paul Hudson. Many credits to his course and the curriculum. I thoroughly enjoyed watching the tutorials over the past weeks/months. 

The Course Projects section shows the applications that I built, while experimenting with the material as reflected in the version that you find here.

The Milestone Projects section shows the milestone projects where Paul Hudson provided the opportunity to his learners to experiment with their own solutions to the challenges.

I mostly enjoyed the project ['Person Lookup'](https://github.com/annalieNK/100DaysofSwiftUI-Portfolio/tree/main/Milestone%20Projects/PersonLookup) where I added my own version of some Favorite Places that I've visited. 


### Looking forward to design and build many more applications!
